## Codebase Patterns
- Use `console.warn` with `[ModuleName]` prefix for missing config warnings
- Use `console.error` with `[FunctionName]` prefix for API failures
- Polar token checks: check at both initialization (polar.ts) and usage (actions.ts)
- Server actions in `lib/db/actions.ts` use `"use server"` directive
- Environment variables accessed via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
- New marketing pages: create folder in `app/(marketing)/[page-name]/page.tsx`
- Footer links to legal pages: `/terms` and `/privacy` routes defined in marketing-footer.tsx

## 2026-01-31 10:45 - US-001
- What was implemented: Enhanced error handling for Polar pricing environment variables
- Files changed:
  - `lib/polar.ts`: Added early warning when POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN is missing
  - `lib/db/actions.ts`: Added pre-check in getPolarProducts() and improved error messages
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Polar SDK is initialized at module load time, so warnings appear at startup
  - getPolarProducts() is already wrapped in try/catch - added early return for missing token
  - Error messages should include function name prefix for easier debugging
  - TypeScript typechecks pass even without POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN (uses empty string fallback)

## 2026-01-31 11:15 - US-002
- What was implemented: Complete rewrite of Terms of Service page for Dojo
- Files changed:
  - `app/(marketing)/terms/page.tsx`: Replaced all content from generic "Vibe Marketing" to Dojo-specific terms
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Legal pages use `FadeIn`, `GradientHeading`, and `SectionCard` components for consistent styling
  - Use `&quot;` for double quotes in JSX text to avoid escaping issues
  - Contact email links should use `text-dojo-cyan hover:underline` class for consistency with site theme
  - Terms page structure: numbered sections with h2 headings, ul lists for bullet points
  - The page is a server component (no "use client" directive needed for static content)

## 2026-01-31 12:30 - US-003
- What was implemented: Created Privacy Policy page for Dojo
- Files changed:
  - `app/(marketing)/privacy/page.tsx`: Created new page with 12 sections covering data collection, analytics, payment processing, content uploads, and user rights
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Privacy page didn't exist - footer linked to `/privacy` but no page was created
  - When footer links to a page that doesn't exist, check for 404s and create missing pages
  - Use `&apos;` for apostrophes in JSX text (e.g., "Polar's privacy policy")
  - Polar payment processing section important for transparency about third-party data handling
  - AI processing disclosure needed when content is transformed by AI systems

## 2026-01-31 12:45 - US-004 & US-005
- What was implemented: Complete FAQ rewrite with Creator and Learner focused questions
- Files changed:
  - `app/(marketing)/marketing-faq.tsx`: Replaced all 8 social media marketing FAQs with Dojo-specific content
- **Creator FAQs added:**
  - Revenue share (70% of net revenue, monthly payouts)
  - Content upload process (AI transforms content into micro-lessons)
  - Content ownership (creator retains IP)
  - Payout timing (monthly, $50 minimum)
- **Learner FAQs added:**
  - Subscription pricing (flexible plans, unlimited access)
  - Lesson format (5-10 minute micro-lessons)
  - Launch timeline (coming soon, join waitlist)
  - Early access benefits (founding member pricing, beta features)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - FAQ grid shows first 4 items, then heading, then items 5-8
  - Both mobile (accordion) and desktop (grid) layouts use same faqItems array
  - Answers should be concise (1-3 sentences) for grid display
  - Include calls-to-action where appropriate (e.g., "Check our pricing page")

## 2026-01-31 13:00 - US-006
- What was implemented: Replaced developer testimonials with creator-focused quotes
- Files changed:
  - `app/(marketing)/marketing-testimonial.tsx`: Replaced 13 fake developer testimonials with 10 creator quotes
- **Changes made:**
  - New heading: "What Creators Are Saying" (was "Customers")
  - Each quote has: name, niche tag (e.g., "Fitness Creator"), and creator-relevant quote
  - Topics covered: revenue share excitement, AI content transformation, ownership retention, passive income, micro-lesson format
  - Creator niches: Fitness, Photography, Culinary, Music, Language, Business, Writing, Design, Yoga, Developer Education
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Username field can include niche tag (e.g., "@handle • Fitness Creator")
  - Reviews array is split in half for two marquee rows (firstRow, secondRow)
  - Images come from `/tweet-avatars/` directory - reuse existing images
  - Keep quotes under 150 characters for good card display
