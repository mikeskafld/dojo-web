# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `console.warn` with `[ModuleName]` prefix for missing config warnings
- Use `console.error` with `[FunctionName]` prefix for API failures
- Polar token checks: check at both initialization (polar.ts) and usage (actions.ts)
- Server actions in `lib/db/actions.ts` use `"use server"` directive
- Environment variables accessed via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`

## 2026-01-31 10:45 - US-001
- What was implemented: Enhanced error handling for Polar pricing environment variables
- Files changed:
  - `lib/polar.ts`: Added early warning when POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN is missing
  - `lib/db/actions.ts`: Added pre-check in getPolarProducts() and improved error messages
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The Polar SDK is initialized at module load time, so warnings appear at startup
  - getPolarProducts() is already wrapped in try/catch - added early return for missing token
  - Error messages should include function name prefix for easier debugging
  - TypeScript typechecks pass even without POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN (uses empty string fallback)

## 2026-01-31 11:15 - US-002
- What was implemented: Complete rewrite of Terms of Service page for Dojo
- Files changed:
  - `app/(marketing)/terms/page.tsx`: Replaced all content from generic "Vibe Marketing" to Dojo-specific terms
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Legal pages use `FadeIn`, `GradientHeading`, and `SectionCard` components for consistent styling
  - Use `&quot;` for double quotes in JSX text to avoid escaping issues
  - Contact email links should use `text-dojo-cyan hover:underline` class for consistency with site theme
  - Terms page structure: numbered sections with h2 headings, ul lists for bullet points
  - The page is a server component (no "use client" directive needed for static content)
