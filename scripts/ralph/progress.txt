## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Next.js 15 project with React 19
- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss
- Marketing pages are in app/(marketing)/ route group
- Authenticated pages are in app/(authenticated)/ route group
- Uses Supabase for backend (auth + database)
- Uses Radix UI for accessible components
- Uses 'motion' library (Framer Motion) for animations
- Existing components in /components/ui/ follow shadcn/ui patterns
- Dojo design system: Use CSS vars (--dojo-cyan, --dojo-bg) and utility classes (dojo-card, dojo-btn-primary)
- Animation patterns: layoutId for toggle animations, AnimatePresence mode="wait" for content swaps
- Use GlowEffect and Magnetic components from /components/ for interactive buttons

# Progress Log

## Project Initialized - Marketing Site Redesign
- PRD created with 17 user stories
- Design reference: jointrybe.com format with pitch deck aesthetics (dark theme, cyan accents)
- Target: Drive creator applications and learner waitlist signups

## 2026-01-30 - US-001: Implement dark theme design system
- **Status**: Already implemented
- **Files**: app/globals.css, app/(marketing)/layout.tsx
- **What was found**:
  - Dojo color palette already defined in globals.css (lines 171-202)
  - `.dojo` theme class overrides shadcn variables (lines 205-239)
  - Utility classes: .dojo-bg, .dojo-card, .dojo-btn-primary, etc.
  - Marketing layout already applies `className="dojo"`
- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Use `.dojo` class on root element to activate dark theme
  - Dojo colors available via CSS vars: --dojo-cyan, --dojo-bg, --dojo-text
  - Use utility classes like .dojo-card for consistent styling
  - Tailwind v4 uses @theme inline in CSS, not tailwind.config.js

## 2026-01-30 - US-002: Redesign marketing navbar with login link
- **Status**: Already implemented
- **Files**: app/(marketing)/marketing-navbar.tsx, app/(marketing)/marketing-header.tsx
- **What was found**:
  - Full navbar implementation exists in marketing-navbar.tsx
  - Uses MainNav component with session prop for conditional auth rendering
  - Logo: lowercase "dojo" text in line 50-52
  - Nav links: How It Works, For Creators, For Learners, About (lines 29-34)
  - Login link: /auth/login on right side (lines 87-91)
  - CTA button: "Get Early Access" with primary styling (lines 93-100)
  - Mobile menu: Sheet component with hamburger trigger (lines 105-155)
  - Sticky header: `sticky top-0 backdrop-blur-md bg-background/80` (line 38)
  - Active state animation with motion/framer-motion (lines 69-75)
- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Marketing header uses Suspense with fallback for session loading
  - Uses shadcn Sheet component for mobile menu
  - Active nav indicator uses framer-motion layoutId for smooth transitions
  - Browser verification blocked by missing .env.local (Supabase credentials)
  - All nav links defined in navItems array for easy updates
  - Responsive breakpoints: lg:flex for desktop nav, lg:hidden for mobile trigger

## 2026-01-30 - US-003: Build homepage hero section with audience toggle
- **Status**: Completed
- **Files**: app/(marketing)/marketing-hero.tsx
- **What was implemented**:
  - Created audience toggle switch (I'm a Creator / I'm a Learner) with animated layoutId indicator
  - Dynamic headline and subheadline content based on toggle selection
    - Creator: "Turn Your Expertise Into Income"
    - Learner: "Master Any Skill in Minutes a Day"
  - Dynamic CTA buttons with AnimatePresence for smooth transitions
    - Creator: "Apply as Creator" -> /for-creators#apply
    - Learner: "Join Waitlist" -> #waitlist
  - Floating social proof stat cards (4 cards: 70%, 3min, 10K+, AI)
    - Each with icon from lucide-react, hover animations, and dojo-card styling
  - Background gradient effects using dojo-gradient-hero and dojo-gradient-radial
  - Animated glow orbs with motion.div for continuous pulsing effect
- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Use layoutId for smooth animated transitions between toggle states
  - AnimatePresence with mode="wait" for clean exit/enter animations
  - Dojo utility classes work well: dojo-text-gradient, dojo-card, dojo-btn-primary, dojo-btn-secondary
  - CSS variable approach: style={{ background: "radial-gradient(circle, var(--dojo-cyan) 0%, transparent 70%)" }}
  - motion.div animate arrays for looping animations: scale: [1, 1.2, 1], repeat: Infinity
  - Social proof stats should link to actual data sources in future (currently static)

## 2026-01-30 - US-004: Create features grid section
- **Status**: Completed
- **Files**:
  - app/(marketing)/dojo-features.tsx (new)
  - app/(marketing)/page.tsx (updated import)
- **What was implemented**:
  - Created DojoFeaturesSection component with 6 Dojo-specific features
  - Features: Universal Scaffolding, Feed-to-Mastery Funnel, AI-Powered Repurposing, Peer-Reviewed Discovery, Native Monetization, Low-Friction Mastery
  - Section headline: "The First Marketplace Powered By Cognitive Scaffolding"
  - Responsive grid: grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 (1x6 mobile, 2x3 tablet, 3x2 desktop)
  - Each card has: lucide-react icon, title, description, dojo-card styling with hover glow
  - Scroll-triggered animations using useInView with staggered reveal (staggerChildren: 0.1)
  - Hover effects: y:-8 lift, border color change to --dojo-border-accent, subtle inset shadow
- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - lucide-react provides good icons for features: Layers, Compass, Sparkles, Users, DollarSign, Zap
  - Use useInView({ once: true, amount: 0.2 }) for scroll-triggered animations
  - containerVariants/itemVariants pattern for staggered animations works well
  - Hover glow overlay pattern: absolute positioned div with opacity transition
  - The old marketing-features.tsx is still in the codebase but no longer used on homepage
  - Build fails due to missing POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET but typecheck and lint pass

  - For vertical mobile arrows, use rotate-90 on ArrowRight icon
  - Sample lesson card pattern: aspect-video container with Play button overlay
  - Connecting lines between steps: absolute positioned div with gradient background
  - lucide-react icons for content types: Video, FileVideo, Podcast

  - Consistent card pattern from DojoFeaturesSection works well across sections
